#Assignment 6: Public Key Cryptogoraphy
##DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: In computer science, cryptography was once only used for the government, spies, and the military, but now it is very commonly used in most websites using SSL. The earliest public key cryptography algorithm and the one we will be focusing on in this assignment is RSA. Public key cryptography uses a pair of keys: public keys and private keys. Someone can encrypt a message using the public key but it can only be decrypted with the private key. The three programs we will be creating are a key generator, an encryptor, and a decryptor. The keygen program will produce key pairs. The encryptor will encrypt files using the public key. And the decryptor will decrypt encrypted files using the private key.
###BUILD FOR PROGRAM: decrypt.c, encrypt.c, keygen.c, numtheory.c, numtheory.h, randstate.c, randstate.h, rsa.c, rsa.h, Makefile, README.md, DESIGN.pdf
####USER GUIDE: The first step to use this program is to use the command make or make decrypt or make encrypt or make keygen. make will effectively be the same as make all where it will make all programs while the others specify a certain part of the program. For keygen, the command-line options available are -b, -i, -n, -d, -s, -v, and -h. The user can use these by typing in ./keygen and then whatever commands they want. -b is the number of bits, -i is the number of iterations, -n is the public key file, -d is the private key file, -s is the seed, -v is teh verbose setting, and -h is the call for help. For both decrypt and encrypt, the command-line options are -i, -o, -n, -v, and -h. The user can use these by typing in ./decrypt or ./encrypt and then the command. -i is to specify the input file, -o is to specify the output file, -n is to specify the private key file for decrypt and the public key file for encrypt, -v is the verbose setting, and -h is the call for help. The user can also just not put in any command to bring up the user manual if they don't do -h.
