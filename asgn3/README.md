#Assignment 2: Sorting: Putting your Affairs in Order
##DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: Sorting elements is a very common computer science concept and there are many different algorithms. In this lab we go over how to do four of them. These include insertion sort, shell sort, heap sort, and quick sort. Each have their own unique takes on sorting which means they differ in number of moves, compares, and compiling time.

###BUILD FOR PROGRAM: this program needs the following: insert.c, insert.h, heap.c, heap.h, quick.c, quick.h, set.h, stats.c, stats.h, shell.c, shell.h, sorting.c, Makefile, README.md, DESIGN.pdf, and WRITEUP.pdf

####HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:To run this program the user should first ask for the help function and to do so they need to type in make and then ./sorting -h. They will be given a list of commands and background for this program. Of these commands they can type in -e to run heap sort, -i to run insertion sort, -s to run shell sort, and -q to run quicksort. -a can even be used to run all at once. Additionally, -n followed by a number indicates the size of the array, -p followed by a number indicates the number of elements to be printed, and -r followed by a number indicates the value of the seed.
